## Hypothesis: If a movie title is classified under the Action genre then it will be more likely to have a higher IMDB user rating.

* Is there a correlation between the year a movie was released and its rating? 
    * Our data, visualized by scatter plots, presents that there is  a higher density of ratings the closer as you    move closer to 2020. This means more ratings are being recorded          over time. However, the correlation coefficient is -0.03
* How many movies are produced and released per MPAA rating category?
   * Our data, visualized by a bar graph, presents that the most commonly produced MPAA ratings are TV-MA (mature audiences) and R. Out of the 21 mpaa ratings, TV-MA consisted of        over 800 titles
   * We also used pie charts to depict the most popular MPAA ratings among three types of genres
        Documentaries have Not Rated as their top MPAA rating at 34.9%
        Shorts have Not Rated as their top MPAA rating at 54.5% 
        Biographies have the R Rating as their top MPAA rating at 42.9%
* Which genre contains the highest average IMDB ratings? 
    * Our data, visualized by a bar graph and histograms, presents that the top three highly rated genres are Documentary, Short, and Biography respectively. The data presented that         Documentaries narrowly beat out Shorts with the highest average IMDB Rating at 7.09 out of 10 
    * Within the Documentary genre, the histogram is             skewed to the left with the most counts belonging to ratings between 6 to 8 out of 10. Within the comedy genre, the most counts per rating were less skewed but Comedy did          not have the highest user rating compared to documentaries.
    * Statistical analysis shows that two of the three  top genres by user rating have the lowest standard deviations. Biography at 0.77, Documentary at 0.92 and Shorts at 1.25.         Presenting that most users rated these genres very highly and there were not many outliers among the data. 

* According to the analysis, our hypothesis was incorrect. The Documentary genre is the most popular genre based on user rating on Netflix.
